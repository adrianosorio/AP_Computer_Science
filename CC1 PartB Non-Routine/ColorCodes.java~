Reflection: 

For this particular assignment at the time I think that the Warm up assignments did not necessarily contributed to this program in many ways as i relied more on personal research of methods and the scanner class. The program was pretty challenging mainly because the I needed to research much of the material to be able to create it however it was enjoyable looking through forums and documentation. I learned about how I declare methods in java along with experience in using the scanner class to gain input from the user. I needed help with creating methods mainly because I did not know what the prefixes meant nor how to set up a scanner. It took me a total of two hours to complete over two days. The best part of the assignment wass trouble shooting errors since from that I was able to learn somethings I can't do in java along with understanding java syntax. If i had to redesign the assignment I would have it so that students would need to use one method in order to not have to repeat chunks of code.
